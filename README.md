# Sensible OpenCV
Android Studio project demonstrating OpenCV Java and C++ harmony

Tested with Android studio 2.1.2 and OpenCV 3.1.0

Out of the box (with small modification, see How to use below), you get:
- Live preview from the Android device's camera orchestrated using Android activity callbacks and Java
- Text stamped on the image from native code using Android NDK and OpenCV C++.

Other features:
- Taking into account orientation changes (thank you [Zarokka](http://answers.opencv.org/question/7313/rotating-android-camera-to-portrait/?answer=29866#post-id-29866)).
Without this, the OpenCV viewer will always orient the images horizontally.
- Automatically pack all C/C++ files from /src/main/jni to module named 'sensible' which is registered in app's build.gradle and MainActivity.java (thank you [DRiFTy](http://stackoverflow.com/a/8980441/5799810)) 

## How to compile

Clone this project and open it in Android Studio.

Grab [OpenCV Android SDK 3.1.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-android/3.1.0/OpenCV-3.1.0-android-sdk.zip/download).

Unzip and put in a safe place, then point the OPENCVROOT variable to that place:

src/main/jni/Android.mk
```
...
OPENCVROOT:= <path to OpenCV sdk>
...
```

Compile, run and enjoy the working Android, OpenCV Java and OpenCV C++ integration.

## How to use

Change the project name to your preference (for example follow [narko](http://stackoverflow.com/a/38011028/5799810)'s suggestions)

Add your C++ files to src/main/jni and they should be automatically compiled. 
If you wish to call a C++ method from Java, define the native method in java (public native void methodName(java arguments)) and then:
- use the javah tool (for Android Studio integration see Step 4 in [HujiaweiBujidao](http://hujiaweibujidao.github.io/blog/2014/10/22/android-ndk-and-opencv-development-with-android-studio)'s blog)
on the java file which will generate a nice header file in the jni directory ([here](app/src/main/jni/primalpond_com_sensibleopencv_MainActivity.h) is an example for such a file)
- OR determine the C++ method name by yourself by combining the package, activity and method name

For passing Mat objects around I use native addresses. See how MainActivity calls putText and how putText.cpp manipulates the Mat.

## Motivation

I call it 'sensible' because I expected all these features from the OpenCV Android SDK. This project puts you on a solid ground to develop your Android vision ideas. Hope to save you the long hours I spent on getting the integration working.
